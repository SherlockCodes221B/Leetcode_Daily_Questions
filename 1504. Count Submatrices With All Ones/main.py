'''
Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the number of submatrices that have all ones.
Input: mat = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: 13
Explanation: 
There are 6 rectangles of side 1x1.
There are 2 rectangles of side 1x2.
There are 3 rectangles of side 2x1.
There is 1 rectangle of side 2x2. 
There is 1 rectangle of side 3x1.
Total number of rectangles = 6 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 13.

                cur = row[i][j]
                for k in range(i, -1, -1):
                    cur = min(cur, row[k][j])
                    if cur == 0:

                    res += cur
